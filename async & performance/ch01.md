# YDKJS Notes: Async & Performance
# Chapter 01: Asyncrony: Now & Later

## A program in chunk

In javascript programs runs in chunks. Which does not happen _now_ will might be happen _later_. We have to understand how those chunks are executed. The _later_ part will happen asyncronously.

*Warning:* It is possible to make syncronous ajax call, doing that is a very bad idea because that will break the UI components.

Anytime we wrap a portion of our program into a `function` and expect to run it after some time, we are creating asyncrony to our program.
