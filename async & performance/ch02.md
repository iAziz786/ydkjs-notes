## Trust issue

Consider this code:
```js
// A
ajax( "..", function(..){
	// C
} );
// B
```
`// A` and `// B` happen now, under the direct control of JS program. But `// C`  gets deferred to happen _later_ and under the control of another party -- in this case  `ajax(..)` function.  

It revolves around the idea that party to which you hand over your program. You don't have control over that party. Looks like we are having some trus issues.

We called this "inversion of control".

### Tale of five callbacks
Imagine you are a developer tasked with building out an ecommerce checkout system. You have implemented almost everything and that works fine. But on the last page when a user click "confirm" you have to make a call to an analytic tracking company so that sale can be tracked.

You notice that they have provided an async tracking utility. In this continuation that you have pass in, you charge the customer's credit card and display a thank you message.

The code might look like this:
```js
analytics.trackPurchase( purchaseData, function(){
	chargeCreditCard();
	displayThankyouPage();
} );
```
After a while a consumer complaint about his credit card charges five time for same product. You get back to find what is the problem. After digging into it you find that analytic tracking provider for some reason calling your callback function five times.

You talk to the provider and raise your consern about this mess. They were experimenting some feature which for some reason calling your provided callback everysecond for the five time until timesout.

You and your boss talked about it and agree that you don't trust that party anymore. Now you need to protect your code with some future vulnerablity. So you write some ad hoc code.
```js
var tracked = false;

analytics.trackPurchase( purchaseData, function(){
	if (!tracked) {
		tracked = true;
		chargeCreditCard();
		displayThankyouPage();
	}
} );
```
Also my things can go wrong. And for each code that you don't trust, you might have to invent awful lot of ad hoc logic. Now you know how hellish can _callback hell_ can go.
### Not just others' code
Can't we just trust the code that we have implemented. To answer to your question let's see something that will lead to a question.

Overly trusting of input:
```js
function addNumbers(x,y) {
	// + is overloaded with coercion to also be
	// string concatenation, so this operation
	// isn't strictly safe depending on what's
	// passed in.
	return x + y;
}

addNumbers( 21, 21 );	// 42
addNumbers( 21, "21" );	// "2121"
```
Defensive against untrusted input:
```js
function addNumbers(x,y) {
	// ensure numerical input
	if (typeof x != "number" || typeof y != "number") {
		throw Error( "Bad parameters" );
	}

	// if we get here, + will safely do numeric addition
	return x + y;
}

addNumbers( 21, 21 );	// 42
addNumbers( 21, "21" );	// Error: "Bad parameters"
```
Or perhaps still safe but friendlier:
```js
function addNumbers(x,y) {
	// ensure numerical input
	x = Number( x );
	y = Number( y );

	// + will safely do numeric addition
	return x + y;
}

addNumbers( 21, 21 );	// 42
addNumbers( 21, "21" );	// 42
```

However you go about it, these sorts of checks/normalizations are fairly common on function inputs, even with code we theoretically entirely trust. In a crude sort of way, it's like the programming equivalent of the geopolitical principle of "Trust But Verify."

So, doesn't it stand to reason that we should do the same thing about composition of async function callbacks, not just with truly external code but even with code we know is generally "under our own control"? Of course we should.

But callbacks don't really offer anything to assist us.

## Trying to save callbacks

Here are few things that we can do that will solve some but not all the problem we're facing with callback hell.
```js
function success(data) {
	console.log( data );
}

function failure(err) {
	console.error( err );
}

ajax( "http://some.url.1", success, failure );
```
Another common callback patter is called "error-first style".
```js
function response(err,data) {
	// error?
	if (err) {
		console.error( err );
	}
	// otherwise, assume success
	else {
		console.log( data );
	}
}

ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
```

But still this doesn't solves the problem of repeated invocaions.
